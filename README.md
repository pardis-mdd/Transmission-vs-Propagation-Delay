# Transmission vs Propagation Delay Simulation


## Description

This project is a simulation of transmission versus propagation delay in a network communication system. It visualizes the delays involved in sending and receiving data packets over a given distance, considering transmission rates and propagation speeds.

## Features

- Adjustable parameters: distance, data rate, propagation speed, and packet size.
- Real-time visualization of transmission and propagation delays.
- Start and restart functionality for the simulation.

## Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend development.
- jQuery for DOM manipulation and event handling.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/pardis-mdd/Transmission-vs-Propagation-Delay.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Usage

1. Adjust the parameters using the sliders and dropdown menus.
2. Click the "Start" button to initiate the simulation.
3. Visualize the transmission and propagation delays in real-time.
4. Experiment with different parameter values to observe their effects on delay.
